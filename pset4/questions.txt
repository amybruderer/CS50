0.  Different colors supported by each format:
    BMP:    4 billion
    GIF:    256
    JPEG:   16.7 million
    PNG:    16.7 million
1.  GIF supports animation.
2.  The difference between lossy and lossless compression is whether or not all the original data can be recovered when uncompressing a compressed file.  Lossless compression completely restores every bit of original data.  Lossy compression allows for some amount of loss, in exchange for reduced file size.
3.  The JPEG format is lossy-compressed.
4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT file system, only the metadata that points to the file is changed.  The actual file data remains untouched.
5.  Physically destroying a disk is a good way to ensure that files you delete cannot be recovered.
6.  stdint.h is a header file that defines integer types with specific width requirements.
7.  Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program provides portability.  These types guarantee a fixed size, regardless of hardware.
8.  A BYTE is 1 byte, a DWORD is 4 bytes, a LONG is 4 bytes, and a WORD is 2 bytes.
9.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must be BM.
10. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of a bitmap file. biSize is the size, in bytes, of the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct.
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with its origin in the upper-left corner.
12. biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth.
13. fopen will return NULL if the output file cannot be created.
14. The third argument to fread is always 1 because we only want to read one object at a time.
15. If bi.biWidth is 3, copy.c:70 assigns 3 to padding.
16. fseek changes the file position indicator by a specified offset.
17. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the file pointer.
